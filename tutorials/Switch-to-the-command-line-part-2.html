<p>Time for part 2:</p>

<p>As i wrote earlier, I've recently switched to the command line. I want to learn this piece of linux also. I've installed a few apps, to replace what i did on a gui. This is what i'm going to tell you about. </p>

<p>The last time I've wrote about Elinks and Moc, and today I'm going to talk about Snownews and Nano. <br />
(Hey, but you sais you're going to talk about Vim! I know, but I've got some comments that Vim is not good for newbie's, so I'm talking about Nano this time.) <br />
In the last part we're going to talk about Cone and Screen.</p>

<p>Lets start with Snownews. Snownews is an command line RSS/RDF reader. I like it because it does what it needs to do, and it is quite simple. </p>

<p>First install it:  </p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install snownews
</code></pre>

<p>You'll need some rss feeds to read in snownews. I have an example feed for the Acer Aspire one Linux Distro Kuki Linux, and that's the one I'll be using here. The address is: http://kuki.me/feed/</p>

<p>Fire up snownews:</p>

<pre><code>snownews
</code></pre>

<p>You'll see a blank screen, because you have no feeds. First add one by pressing a. Type the feed address, in our example that is: http://kuki.me/feed/. Then press enter. Now it will load the feed. You can add more feeds, if you have site's you follow. If you want to quit, press q. </p>

<p>If you then again fire up Snownews, then you'll have to reload the feeds to check for new items. That is done by presing R (SHIFT+r). If you just want to reload 1 feed, then pres the normal r.</p>

<p>If don't want to check every feed seperatly, then you'll have to press H (Shift+h), and you'll see all the new headlines for your feeds. </p>

<p>Removing a feed can be done by moving upon the feed, and pressing D (Shift+d).</p>

<p>Snownews has a very nice feature, you can automatticly open a feed in the browser. To do that, you'll first have to define the browser you are using. If your command line only, then you'll probably use Links, Elinks, W3M or lynx. Press B (Shift+b) and type the browser of choice. I typed: elinks. </p>

<p>I have not tested if it works, but you can try to type firefox, if you use firefox. Note that you'll have to be on a machine with an X server installed, and you'll need to be working from a virtual terminal like xterm or konsole/gnome-terminal.</p>

<p>Now lets talk about nano.</p>

<p>Nano is a very small text editor, and it works unlike Vim with keyboard shortcuts like CTRL+X or CTRL+O. In the program that is shown as ^X of ^O.</p>

<p>In ubuntu it is standard, so fire it up:</p>

<pre><code>nano
</code></pre>

<p>There we have it. Lets write some basic stuff. The last part of this tut is being written in Nano. Or do some Lorem Ipsum stuff. <br />
If you've got some text, you can save it by pressing CTRL+O (WriteOut). Then enter a filename like test.txt or index.html and press Enter. <br />
If you want to open something in nano, like /etc/fstab then you'll need to do it like this:</p>

<pre><code>nano /etc/fstab
</code></pre>

<p>If you have a large file and you want to search, then press CTRL+W (WhereIs) and enter the search phrase. If it is found, it will place the cursor there, and else it will say [ "search" not found ]. <br />
And when you want to exit Nano just press CTRL+X, and if you want to save press Y then, and enter the filename. Thats All, it couldn't be simpler.</p>

<p>This was part 2 of my Command line switch. In the last part i'm going to talk about Cone (E-Mail) and Screen. If you have any suggestions, then just leavea comment, and then I'll reply to it.</p>
